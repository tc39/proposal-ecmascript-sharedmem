<p>Some algorithms and semantics in this proposal are presented as modifications to existing ES262 algorithms and semantics.  The base revision of ES262 for the modifications (here denoted "ES7") is currently f35248729043089b47ccf29e4c47559386f5f6fd (2016-06-29).  At the moment, ES7 (ES2016) section numbering differs from ES6 (ES2015) only for TypedArrays (section 22.2).</p>

<emu-intro id="intro">
<h1>Introduction</h1>

<p>This proposal adds a simple form of shared memory to ECMAScript.
Shared memory is being exposed in the form of a new SharedArrayBuffer
type; the existing TypedArray and DataView types are adapted in such a way
that they can be used to create views on shared memory.  The new
global Atomics object provides atomic operations on shared memory
locations, including operations that can be used to create blocking
synchronization primitives.  Though not a part of this specification,
we intend for the role of "threads" to be played by Web Workers in web
browser environments.<p>

<p>At this time the proposal adds only low-level primitives to
ECMAScript; we expect the developer community to put together
abstractions that are useful in specific domains.</p>

<p>The work has been driven by the following use cases: <p>

<ul>
  <li>Support for threaded code in programs written in other
  languages that are translated to asm.js or plain JS or a combination
  of the two, notably C and C++ but also other, safe, languages.

  <li>Support for hand-written JS or JS+asm.js that makes use of
  multiprocessing facilities for select tasks, such as image
  processing, asset management, or game AI.
</ul>

<p>The proposal makes only very basic assumptions about the required
hardware and should be broadly implementable with good performance.
Prototype implementations of the API are available in Firefox and in
Google Chrome.</p>

<p>This specification constitutes a restatement and formalization of
an earlier
work, <a href="https://github.com/tc39/ecmascript_sharedmem/blob/master/historical/Spec_JavaScriptSharedMemoryAtomicsandLocks.pdf">the
spec document for which</a> also contains additional rationale,
background information, discussions, implementation notes, and
comments.</p>

<p>Changelog:</p>
<ul>
  <li>2016-10-24 -- Rewrote memory model, again, to be axiomatic.
  <li>2016-07-22 -- Editorial fixes.
  <li>2016-07-21 -- Replace [[SharedArrayBufferData]] and [[SharedArrayBufferByteLength]] with [[ArrayBufferData]] and [[ArrayBufferByteLength]]; remove specialization that was based on the removed properties and instead use type checks with IsSharedArrayBuffer in ArrayBuffer, SharedArrayBuffer, and Atomics methods; spec that Shared Data Blocks are distinguishable (by unspecified means) from regular Data Blocks and use this to defined IsSharedArrayBuffer.
  <li>2016-07-20 -- Editorial fix: clarify the operator passed to AtomicFetchOp.
  <li>2016-07-13 -- Editorial fixes.
  <li>2016-07-11 -- Rewrote the memory model section, which introduced separate access functions for shared memory, and caused many other changes.
  <li>2016-07-05 -- Rewrote (and shrunk) the informative Web Browser Embedding section so that it only addresses the requirements of this spec, not how HTML ought to evolve.
  <li>2016-07-05 -- Rephrased the wait/wake mutual exclusion in terms of critical sections named by (G,i), as the old specification was too strong.
  <li>2016-06-30 -- Algorithms that are modified relative to their ES262 forms include more context and are more clearly marked, and there's a defined ES262 base revision for those modifications.  Updated section references to reference that revision.
  <li>(Older changelog removed)
</ul>

      <p>Insert the following paragraphs after the third:</p>

      <p>A data block that resides in memory that can be referenced from multiple agents concurrently is designated a <dfn>Shared Data Block</dfn>.  A Shared Data Block has an identity (for the purposes of equality testing Shared Data Block values) that is <em>address-free</em>: it is tied not to the virtual addresses the block is mapped to in any process, but to the set of locations in memory that the block represents.  Shared Data Blocks can also be distinguished from Data Blocks.</p>

      <p>The semantics of Shared Data Blocks is defined using Shared Data Block events by the Atomics memory model. Abstract operations below introduce ReadSharedMemory and WriteSharedMemory events during evaluation. All events introduced during an evaluation form a graph, which is called a candidate execution. The memory model does not admit all candidate executions; the allowed candidate executions are called valid executions. There are many valid executions for a given evaluation, and one is assumed to be nondeterministically chosen and agreed upon by all agents in an agent cluster. The values of ReadSharedMemory events in an evaluation are defined with respect to the chosen valid execution.</p>

      <p>NOTE: Introducing an event and taking the value of an event are not algorithmic. For example, using the value of a ReadSharedMemory event in a WriteSharedMemory event does not mean, as it would if those events were abstract operations, that the ReadSharedMemory event must be computed first before introducing the WriteSharedMemory event. There is no notion of computation in the memory model, and it may permit cycles between such pairs of events.</p>

    </emu-table>

    <p>Once the values of [[Signifier]], [[IsLockFree1]], and
    [[IsLockFree2]] have been observed by any agent in the agent
    cluster they cannot change.</p>

    <emu-note>
      <p>The values of [[IsLockFree1]] and [[IsLockFree2]] are not
        necessarily determined by the hardware, but may also reflect
        implementation choices that can vary over time and between
        ECMAScript implementations.</p>

      <p>There is no [[IsLockFree4]] property: 4-byte atomic
        operations are always lock-free.</p>

      <p>Formally, atomic operations are lock-free if, infinitely
        often, some atomic operation finishes in a finite number of
        program steps.  In practice, if an atomic operation is
        implemented with any type of lock the operation is not
        lock-free.  Lock-free does not imply wait-free: there is no
        upper bound on how many machine steps may be required to
        complete a lock-free atomic operation.</p>

      <p>That an atomic access of size <em>n</em> is lock-free does
        not imply anything about the (perceived) atomicity of
        non-atomic accesses of size <em>n</em>, specifically,
        non-atomic accesses may still be performed as a sequence of
        several separate memory accesses.  See ReadSharedMemory and
        WriteSharedMemory for details.</p>
    </emu-note>

  </emu-clause>

  <emu-clause id="ExecutableCodeAndContexts.AgentCluster">
    <h1>Agent Clusters (NEW)</h1>

    <p>An <em>agent cluster</em> is a maximal set of agents that can
      communicate by operating on shared memory.</p>

    <emu-note>
      <p>Programs within different agents may share memory by
        unspecified means.  At a minimum, the backing memory for
        SharedArrayBuffer objects can be shared among the agents in
        the cluster.</p>

      <p>There may be agents that can communicate by message passing
	that cannot share memory; they are never in the same
	cluster.</p>
    </emu-note>

    <p>Every agent belongs to exactly one agent cluster.</p>

    <emu-note>
      <p>The agents in a cluster need not all be alive at some
	particular point in time.  If agent <b>A</b> creates another
	agent <b>B</b>, after which <b>A</b> terminates and <b>B</b>
	creates agent <b>C</b>, the three agents are in the same
	cluster if <b>A</b> could share some memory with <b>B</b>
	and <b>B</b> could share some memory with <b>C</b>.</p>
    </emu-note>

    <p>All agents within a cluster must have the same value for
      the [[LittleEndian]] property in their respective Agent Records.</p>

    <emu-note>
      <p>If different agents within an agent cluster have different
        values of [[LittleEndian]] it becomes hard to use shared
        memory for multi-byte data.</p>
    </emu-note>

    <p>All agents within a cluster must have the same values for
      the [[IsLockFree1]] property in their respective Agent Records; similarly for
      the [[IsLockFree2]] property.</p>

    <p>All agents within a cluster must have different values for
      the [[Signifier]] property in their respective Agent Records.</p>

    <p>An agent cluster is a specification mechanism and need not correspond to
      any particular artefact of an ECMAScript implementation.</p>

    <p>An embedding may deactivate (stop forward progress) or
      activate (resume forward progress) an agent without the agent's
      knowledge or cooperation.  If the embedding does so, it must not
      leave some agents in the cluster active while other agents in
      the cluster are deactivated indefinitely.</p>

    <emu-note>
      <p>The purpose of the preceding restriction is to avoid a
        situation where an agent deadlocks or starves because another
        agent has been suspended.  For example, if a DOM SharedWorker
        shares memory with a regular worker, and the regular worker is
        suspended while it holds a lock (because the web page the
        regular worker is in is pushed into the window history), and
        the SharedWorker tries to acquire the lock, then the
        SharedWorker will be blocked until the regular worker wakes up
        again, if ever.  Meanwhile other workers trying to access the
        SharedWorker from other web pages will starve.</p>

      <p>The implication of the restriction is that it will not be
        possible to share memory between agents that don't belong to
        the same suspend/wake collective within the embedding.</p>
    </emu-note>

    <p>An embedding may terminate an agent without any of the agent's
      cluster's other agents' prior knowledge or cooperation.  If an
      agent is terminated not by programmatic action of its own or of
      another agent in the cluster but by forces external to the
      cluster, then the embedding must choose one of two strategies:
      Either terminate all the agents in the cluster, or provide
      reliable APIs that allow the agents in the cluster to coordinate
      so that at least one remaining member of the cluster will be
      able to detect the termination, with the termination data
      containing enough information to identify the agent that was
      terminated.</p>

    <emu-note>
      <p>Examples of that type of termination are: operating systems
        or users terminating agents that are running in separate
        processes; the embedding itself terminating an agent that is
        running in-process with the other agents when per-agent
        resource accounting indicates that the agent is runaway.</p>
    </emu-note>

    <emu-note>
      <p>This proposal additionally suggests (see later text) that if
        termination is signaled then the signal creates a
        synchronizes-with edge in the memory ordering.</p>

  <p>The Atomics object provides functions that operate indivisibly (atomically) on shared memory array cells as well as functions that let agents wait for and dispatch primitive events.  When used with discipline, the Atomics functions allow multi-agent programs that communicate through shared memory to execute in a well-understood order even on parallel CPUs.  The rules that govern shared-memory communication are provided by the <dfn>memory model</dfn>, defined below.</p>
  <p>The value of the [[Prototype]] internal slot of the Atomics object is the intrinsic object %ObjectPrototype%.</p>
  <p>The Atomics object is not a function object. It does not have a [[Construct]] internal method; it is not possible to use the Atomics object as a constructor with the `new` operator. The Atomics object also does not have a [[Call]] internal method; it is not possible to invoke the Atomics object as a function.</p>

  <emu-clause id="MemoryModel">
    <h1>Memory Model</h1>

    <p>The memory consistency model, or memory model, specifies the possible orderings of operations on SharedArrayBuffer objects, both directly and via methods on the Atomics object. When the program has no data races, the ordering of operations appears as sequentially consistent, i.e., as an interleaving of actions from each agent. When the program has data races, shared memory operations may appear sequentially inconsistent. For example, programs may exhibit causality-violating behavior and other astonishments. These astonishments arise from compiler transforms and the design of CPUs (e.g., out-of-order execution and speculation). The memory model defines both the precise conditions under which a program exhibits sequentially consistent behavior as well as the allowable effects of data races.</p>

    <p>The memory model is defined as relational constraints on events introduced by abstract operations on SharedArrayBuffer or by methods on the Atomics object during an evaluation.</p>

    <emu-note>
      <p>This section provides an axiomatic model on events introduced by the abstract operations on SharedArrayBuffers, via direct manipulation or the Atomics object. It bears stressing that the model is not expressible algorithmically like the rest of this specification. The introduction of events by abstract operations is the interface between the operational evaluation of ECMAScript and axiomatic memory model. The semantics of these events is defined by considering graphs consisting of all events in an evaluation. These are neither Static Semantics nor Runtime Semantics. There is no demonstrated algorithmic implementation, but instead a set of constraints that determine if a particular outcome of evaluation is allowed or disallowed.</p>

      <p>(spec draft note) Acknowledgement: The description of many fundamentals and sequentially consistent execution owes much to the LLVM memory model.</p>
    </emu-note>

    <emu-clause id="MemoryModel.Fundamentals">
      <h1>Fundamentals</h1>

      <p>Shared memory accesses (reads and writes) are divided into two groups, atomic accesses and data accesses, defined below. Atomic accesses are sequentially consistent, i.e., there is a total ordering of events agreed upon by all agents in an agent cluster. Non-atomic accesses do not have a total ordering agreed upon by all agents, i.e., unordered.</p>

      <emu-note>
        No orderings weaker than sequentially consistent and stronger than unordered, such as release-acquire, are supported.
      </emu-note>

      <p>A <dfn>Shared Data Block event</dfn> is a ReadSharedMemory(_order_, _block_, _byteIndex_, _elementSize_) event, a WriteSharedMemory(_order_, _block_, _byteIndex_, _elementSize_, _bytes_) event, or a ReadModifyWriteSharedMemory(_order_, _block_, _byteIndex_, _elementSize_, _bytes_, _op_) event introduced by an abstract operation or by a Function property on the Atomics object. Allowed values for _order_ are `"SeqCst"`, `"Unordered"`, and `"Init"`. ReadModifyWriteSharedMemory events always have _order_ `"SeqCst"`. These events may be referred to simply as ReadSharedMemory, WriteSharedMemory or ReadModifyWriteSharedMemory events. Additionally, Shared Data Block events include host-specific events.</p>

      <p>Let the <dfn>range</dfn> of a ReadSharedMemory, WriteSharedMemory, or ReadModifyWriteSharedMemory event be the List of contiguous integers from its _byteIndex_ to _byteIndex_+_elementSize_-1. Two events' ranges are equal when the events have the same _block_, and the ranges are element-wise equal. Two events' ranges are overlapping when the events have the same _block_, the ranges are not equal and their intersection is non-empty. Two events' ranges are disjoint when the events do not have the same _block_ or their ranges their neither equal nor overlapping.</p>

      <emu-note>
        <p>Examples of host-specific synchronizing events that should be accounted for are: sending a SharedArrayBuffer from one agent to another (e.g., by `postMessage` in a browser), starting and stopping agents, and communicating within the agent cluster via channels other than shared memory.</p>

      <p>Neither the synchronizes-with relation nor the Sequentially Consistent Atomics requirement guarantees access atomicity for atomic events. Both are concerned with ordering of atomic operations on equal ranges, but it is possible to have sequentially consistent equal-ranged atomics without access atomicity. For example, consider the following program where `U8` and `U16` are aliased 1-byte and 2-byte views on the same Shared Data Block.</p>

      <pre>W1: U16[a] = 1; W2: U8[a] = 2; || R: observe(U16[a]);</pre>

      <ul>
        <li>`R` synchronizes-with `W1`</li>
        <li>`R` reads-from `W1`</li>
        <li>`R` reads-from `W2`</li>
        <li>`W1` is memory-order before `W2` and `W2` is memory-order before `R`.</li>
      </ul>

      <p>`W2` is allowed to come between `W1` and `R` in memory-order because it and `R` do not have equal ranges. Thus, `R` may read a value composed of bytes written by both `W1` and `W2`.</p>

      <p>Note that this candidate execution is not data race free.</p>

      <p>Data race free executions guarantee access atomicity for `"SeqCst"` events. In such executions, `"SeqCst"` events _R_ and _W_ such that _W_ synchronizes-with _R_ means that _R_ reads-from _W_ and no other events.</p>

          High-performance algorithms will use Atomics.isLockFree to
          determine whether to use locks or atomic operations in

    <h1>Compiler Transform Guidelines</h1>
    <p>Given a host-defined notion of observable behavior of programs, the following restrictions apply to compiler transforms for non-atomics operations.</p>

    <ul>
      <li>An API call introducing a single Shared Data Block event that affects observable behavior cannot be transformed into API calls introducing multiple Shared Data Block events.
      <li>API calls introducing WriteSharedMemory or ReadModifyWriteSharedMemory events that affect observable behavior may not have their ranges narrowed.
      <li>API calls introducing WriteSharedMemory or ReadModifyWriteSharedMemory events that affect observable behavior may not be removed.
      <li>API calls introducing WriteSharedMemory or ReadModifyWriteSharedMemory events that both affect observable behavior and would not have otherwise arisen may not be introduced.
    </ul>

    <emu-note>
      <p>API calls introducing Shared Data Block events may be introduced, elided, or merged if they do not affect observable behavior of the program. For example, nonbinding prefetches of cache lines, assuming correctness of invalidations, are allowed. Contrastingly, rematerializing an observable read is not. For example, the following two programs are not equivalent.</p>

      <pre>let x = M[a]; if (x) observe(x);</pre>

      <p>and</p>

      <pre>if (M[a]) observe(M[a]);</pre>

    <p>The following additional restrictions apply to compiler transforms for atomic operations.</p>

    <ul>
      <li>API calls introducing `"SeqCst"` events that affect observable behavior may not be reordered.
    </ul>

    <p>The following additional restriction apply to compiler transforms for data race free programs.</p>

    <ul>
      <li>API calls introducing Shared Data Block events that do not affect observable behavior may not be transformed to API calls that result in shared memory events that affect observable behavior.

    <p>For architectures no weaker than ARM or Power, non-atomic stores and loads may be compiled to bare stores and loads on the target architecture. Atomic stores and loads may be compiled down to instructions that guarantee sequential consistency. If no such instructions exist, memory barriers are to be employed, such as placing barriers on both sides of a bare store or load. Read-modify-write operations may be compiled to read-modify-write instructions on the target architectrue, such as `LOCK`-prefixed instructions on x86 and load-link/store-conditional instructions on ARM.</p>

<emu-clause id="WebBrowserEmbedding">
  <h1>Web browser embedding (informative)</h1>

  <p>This section outlines how the Shared Memory and Atomics
    specification fits into the current web ecosystem with the minimum
    amount of change to that ecosystem.  This section is not part of
    the proposal, it is informative only.</p>

  <p>In a web browser an <em>agent</em> is an HTML <em>event
    loop</em> <a href="https://html.spec.whatwg.org/multipage/webappapis.html#event-loops">[here]</a>.
    The event loop is realized as either a main thread (which may be
    shared among tabs, as it is in Firefox) or some type of worker
    thread.  The event loops are running jobs in the sense of ES262,
    and the forward-progress requirement of this specification
    (section&nbsp;3.1.1) is generally met as long as each agent has
    its own dedicated operating system thread or shared-thread agents
    can't block.</p>

  <p>Browsers will typically let agents that run on the browser's
    main thread have [[CanBlock]] equal to *false*, to prevent blocking the
    UI and to allow the main thread to do work on behalf of other
    threads.</p>

  <p>Normal ("dedicated") `Worker`s must be supported as agents for
    this proposal to make much sense.</p>

  <p>Memory will be shared among agents by using `postMessage` to
    transmit SharedArrayBuffer objects or TypedArray objects that
    have SharedArrayBuffer buffers; this requires an extension to
    the Structured Clone mechanism.  There is agreement on the general
    syntax and semantics for that extension.</p>

  <p>Agent-to-agent communication extends the synchronizes-with relation
    of the program, as follows:</p>

  <ul>
    <li>The call to the `Worker` constructor in the parent
      synchronizes-with the execution of the main script in the worker.

    <li>(Worker termination is not directly observable in current
      browsers, but this is a moot point; see below.)

    <li>A `postMessage` to another agent synchronizes-with the event
      that fires in the agent.
 </ul>

  <p>So long as the browser does not allow a `ServiceWorker` or
    `SharedWorker` ("non-page worker") to share memory with a `Worker`
    it will not violate the suspend/wake cohort rule of this
    specification (section&nbsp;3.3).  The restriction on sharing
    memory can be implemented in the extension to the Structured Clone
    mechanism.  For example, a non-page worker may simply not be
    allowed to receive shared memory (leading to a null value or an
    error signal).  There is not yet any agreement on this point, but
    it is clear that the restriction must be on the receiving side of
    the communication, as the sender may be sending on a `MessagePort`
    that is not yet connected, but may in the future be connected to
    either a valid or invalid recipient.</p>

  <p>At the moment, I believe dedicated workers are in the same
    process as their owning tab in all browsers, so if the process
    crashes then the workers will crash too.  I also don't know any
    reason a browser should forcibly terminate a worker except when a
    tab is closed.  In sum, the termination signaling requirement of
    this specification (section&nbsp;3.3) is probably met by existing
    browsers.</p>

  <p>The web platform should evolve to serve the shared memory use
    case better: by incorporating inspectable worker state and worker
    lifecycle events, and by tightening the wording in the HTML spec
    (currently the browser is allowed to kill a worker at any time for
    any reason, which is not quite what we want).  WebIDL should
    evolve to allow Web APIs to be described as to when they can and
    cannot receive shared memory parameters.  However, only an
    extension to the Structured Clone algorithm is needed to support
    the Shared Memory and Atomics specification in practice on current
    browsers.</p>
